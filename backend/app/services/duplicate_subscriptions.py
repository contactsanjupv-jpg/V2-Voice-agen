"""
Second line of defence against paying twice (the first is services/checkout_guard).

If an org somehow holds more than one trialing/active Paddle subscription, the
OLDEST one is the subscription of record (billing_state.current_subscription uses
the same rule). Every other one is scheduled to cancel at the END of its paid
period: the customer is not charged again, nobody loses access mid-period, and
nothing is refunded or deleted automatically — the first charge of the duplicate
may need a manual refund, which is logged at ERROR level for a human.

Safe to run repeatedly and from concurrent workers: a Redis marker per
subscription means each cancel is requested once; a failed request clears the
marker so it is retried by the next webhook or reconciliation run.
